# pyPOD

My version of a touch screen switch pod

As an owner of a Jeep Wrangler, I like the idea if the touchscreen sPOD, but the cost is a limiting factor. So I picked up a Raspberry Pi, a book on Python, and, well... This is the result.

This is designed to be infinantly expandable with any number of relays.

Options for hardware are currently based on either the Raspberry Pi 3 (wifi/bluetooth connectivity) or the Raspberry Pi Zero W (wifi/bluetooth connectivity).

The plan is to also integrate smartphone connectivity, via bluetooth/wifi, to the pyPOD for use outside the cabin of the vehicle.
